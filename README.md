# snapraid-diff-sync
This minimal SnapRAID script is based on https://github.com/auanasgheps/snapraid-aio-script

#### Tested on Void Linux Musl

I tried other SnapRAID scripts written for Ubuntu/Debian they didn't play well with Void/Slackware.

This script and the snapraid-aio-script appears to work correctly.

#### Requirements:
mklog

```pip install mklog```

snapraid

```xbps-install snapraid```

femtomail - Optional
